# JSDrumKit
### This is a Java Script 30 project that recreates a Drum Kit using keyboard keys like each of the components of a real drum set.
In this project I practiced and delved into handling JS events, CSS animations and DOM handling. I also learned to invoke external audio by pressing a certain key on the keyboard.
